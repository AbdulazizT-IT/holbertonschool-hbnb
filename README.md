# 📘 HBnB Evolution - Part 1: Technical Documentation

This folder contains the technical documentation for the **HBnB Evolution** project — a simplified version of an Airbnb-like platform.

## 🎯 Objective

To define the overall system architecture and business logic design before implementation. This documentation serves as a blueprint for the following development phases.

## 🗂️ Contents

- ✅ **High-Level Package Diagram**: Illustrates the three-layer architecture (Presentation, Business Logic, Persistence) and their interactions using the facade pattern.
- ✅ **Detailed Class Diagram**: Covers the main entities (User, Place, Review, Amenity) with their attributes, methods, and relationships.
- ✅ **Sequence Diagrams** for key API interactions:
  - User registration
  - Place creation
  - Review submission
  - Fetching list of places

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- [draw.io](https://draw.io) or [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org) for creating UML diagrams
- UML notation for consistency and clarity

## 📌 Notes

- All entities have a unique ID, created_at, and updated_at timestamps.
- Documentation is aligned with the project requirements and will guide implementation in later stages.
