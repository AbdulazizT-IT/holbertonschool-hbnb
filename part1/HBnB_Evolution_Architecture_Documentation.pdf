ðŸ“– Introduction
The HBnB Evolution project is a simplified clone of the AirBnB platform, designed to demonstrate the architecture and design of a full-featured web application. It manages key components such as users, places, reviews, and amenities.

This document serves as a technical reference that outlines the systemâ€™s structure and interactions. It includes:

A high-level architecture diagram to show the separation of concerns across the Presentation, Business Logic, and Persistence layers.

A detailed class diagram explaining the relationships and attributes of core entities.

Sequence diagrams that illustrate how different components communicate during key operations like user registration and place creation.

The goal of this documentation is to provide a clear and organized blueprint that will guide the development and implementation phases of the HBnB system.
